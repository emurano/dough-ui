# Text

Formats the text given in the standard text style.

Use this component to output generic text when other, more specific text-based components don't meet your requirements.

<Canvas of={TextStories.Primary} />

## Props

<Controls />


## Sizes

Text has a set of preset sizes that you can use:

 - `extra-small`
 - `small`
 - `medium`
 - `large`
 - `extra-large`

<Canvas of={TextStories.LargeExample} sourceState="shown" withToolbar={false} />


## Parent-relative size

By default, the size presets are based off the document's root font-size. You can make it so that the size is based on
the parent's font-size.

 - `parent-relative` - base the preset size on the parent's font-size
 - `globally-relative` - base the preset size on the root font-size

Typically, you'll want the size mode to be `globally-relative`, as most of the time text needs to be a predictable size.

When building a compound component with many different components within it, you might want to use `parent-relative`,
as this will make the text's size relative to the rest of the component. This keeps the component's elements congruent
with each other.


#### `parent-relative` Examples

These examples show that the preset size makes the text larger or smaller than the parent's font-size.

#### `parent-relative` with large preset

<Canvas of={TextStories.ParentRelativeLargeExample} sourceState="shown" withToolbar={false} />

#### `parent-relative` with small preset

<Canvas of={TextStories.ParentRelativeSmallExample} sourceState="shown" withToolbar={false} />

#### `globally-relative` Examples

These examples show that the preset size makes the text larger or smaller than the document's font-size and the parent's
font-size has no effect.

#### `globally-relative` with large preset

<Canvas of={TextStories.GloballyRelativeLargeExample} sourceState="shown" withToolbar={false} />

#### `globally-relative` with small preset

<Canvas of={TextStories.GloballyRelativeSmallExample} sourceState="shown" withToolbar={false} />
